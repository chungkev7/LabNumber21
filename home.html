	<p>11/1/19 - Time management will always be an important skill, as time is a limited resource.<br>
	Know which tasks and goals need to be completed first.</p>
	
	<p>10/15/19 - The amount of time put into something does not always equal to the work output result.
	There will be times when you understand something really quickly, and there will be times when it takes
	a little longer. Be patient with yourself, and seek assistance when needed.</p>

	<p>10/1/19 - There will be days where you feel the best, and there will be days that you will feel not the greatest.
	Take the time to take care of yourself, to make sure you're feeling energized and refreshed!</p>

	<p>There are many people that misprounce Ypsilanti (it's pronounced as 
	IP-sil-AN-tee) for those who don't recognize the city. Ypsilanti, located east of Ann Arbor,
	home of Eastern Michigan University, is an historic city founded in the early 1800s.</p>

	<p>Notable people that were from Ypsilanti include Adam Gase (New York Jets head coach),
	Russell C. Ostrander (former mayor of Lansing and Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court),
	and Walter Briggs Sr (Detroit Tigers owner from 1919-1952).</p>
